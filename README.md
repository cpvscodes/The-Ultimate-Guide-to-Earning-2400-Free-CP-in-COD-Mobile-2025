### What Are COD Points (CP)?

COD Points (CP) are the in-game currency used in COD Mobile to purchase a variety of premium items. These items range from skins, weapon blueprints, and calling cards to the battle pass. CP is available for purchase with real money, but there are ways to earn them for free, saving you some cash while still enjoying premium content.

### How to Get 2400 CP for Free in COD Mobile 2025

Now, letâ€™s dive into the methods that will allow you to earn 2400 CP at no cost. While some methods require a bit of time and effort, they can reward you with substantial amounts of CP. Here are some of the most effective ways:

#### 1. **Participate in Official COD Mobile Events**

One of the easiest ways to earn free CP is by participating in official COD Mobile events. These events often offer rewards like CP, skins, and other exclusive items for completing specific tasks. In 2025, COD Mobile has continued to host frequent events, ranging from daily challenges to seasonal events. By logging in and completing the event tasks, you can earn a generous amount of CP without spending a dime.

#### 2. **Complete the Battle Pass Missions**

Another great way to earn free CP is by progressing through the Battle Pass missions. While the Battle Pass itself requires a purchase, the free tier of the Battle Pass still provides some CP rewards as you level up. If you play regularly, you can easily complete missions that will add to your CP balance. By the time you reach the higher levels, youâ€™ll have earned significant amounts of CP, and that could add up to 2400 CP over time.

#### 3. **Use Third-Party Apps for Gift Cards**

You can also use third-party apps that reward you with gift cards or COD Mobile credits in exchange for completing simple tasks. Apps like Google Opinion Rewards, Mistplay, or Swagbucks allow users to earn points by taking surveys, watching ads, or downloading apps. These points can be redeemed for gift cards, which can then be used to purchase CP for COD Mobile.

#### 4. **Take Advantage of Free CP Promotions**

COD Mobile often runs promotions where players can earn free CP just by logging into the game. These promotions are usually part of seasonal events or special celebrations. Make sure to check the in-game announcements frequently to see if there are any ongoing promotions offering free CP. 

#### 5. **Watch Live Streams and Participate in Giveaways**

Another way to score free CP is by watching live streams or participating in giveaways hosted by popular streamers or COD Mobile influencers. Many content creators regularly host giveaways where they provide free CP as rewards to their viewers. Keep an eye on your favorite COD Mobile streamers or YouTubers, as they often run giveaways that could land you the CP you need.

### Final Thoughts

While COD Mobile offers plenty of ways to spend real money on CP, there are also several legitimate methods for getting free CP. By participating in in-game events, completing missions, or taking advantage of third-party apps and giveaways, you can easily accumulate up to 2400 CP without spending any money.
